Hi there, I'm Felipe and I'll share with you informations about networking, cibersecurity and technology. I hope it helps.

Now, I want to tell you about what things we will cover here, since saying cybersecurity and networks is very broad. In terms of cybersecurity, you will find only the **red team**, whether it's CTF (Capture The Flag) writeups like Hack The Box, as tutorials on how tools and vulnerabilities work. In terms of network, you will find configuration guides, maintenance, equipment, resolution either in routers or switches, all this focus mainly on cisco equipment, although I will make a post later on equivalents to the commands configurations in Huawei too.
