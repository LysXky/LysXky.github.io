Hi my name is Felipe Tapia network engineer, I'm study in Duoc UC and I graduated in May 2021, I feel a great passion for the area of networks and cybersecurity.

In this blog you can find information regarding those two topics, networking, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

About cybersecurity I will share commands that I usually use, write up of Hack The Box machines.

> **Note**: if you have any questions, contact me via email and I will try to respond as soon as possible.
